Visualizations:
Region-Wise Quantity Sold:

A bar chart showing the distribution of quantities sold across regions.
Month-Wise Revenue:

A line chart visualizing revenue trends across different months.
Revenue by Item Type:

A pie chart displaying the revenue contribution of each product category, such as Baby Food, Fruits, and Beverages.

Year-Wise Profit:
A bar chart highlighting annual profits from 2010 to 2017.

Key Insights:-

Region Performance:
The highest quantities sold were in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, while other regions like Europe showed moderate performance.

Monthly Revenue Trends:
Revenue peaked during specific months, indicating high-demand periods, possibly driven by seasonal or promotional sales.

Item Type Contribution:
Categories like Baby Food and Cosmetics contributed significantly to overall revenue.

Yearly Profit Growth:
A consistent upward trend in annual profits was observed, reflecting successful growth strategies and cost management.

Steps Followed:-

Data Cleaning:
Verified column values and removed duplicates.
Ensured consistency in date formatting and numeric values.

Analysis:
Created Pivot Tables to analyze revenue, profit, and units sold across multiple dimensions (region, product type, and sales channel).
Derived insights from comparisons of revenue and cost data.

Dashboard Design:

Developed an interactive layout using Pivot Charts.
Employed slicers and filters for user-friendly navigation.

Challenges Addressed:-

Large Dataset Handling:
Optimized performance using Power Pivot for efficient aggregation and visualization.

User-Centric Design:
Balanced the display of detailed insights while maintaining simplicity for non-technical users.

Interactivity:
Added slicers to allow for customized analysis by year, region, and product type.
