Bank Loan Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes bank loan data to extract insights regarding loan approvals, customer risk factors, and financial trends. By assessing loan eligibility and identifying potential risks, the project aims to support data-driven decision-making in loan management.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Use Excel to handle missing values, correct data inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and trends in loan approval and customer segmentation.
Risk Factor Analysis: Highlight segments with higher risk of default.
Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive Tableau dashboards for summarizing and visualizing loan data.

Data Used:
The dataset includes customer and loan-related details such as:

Applicant Information: Age, gender, marital status, and education.
Financial Data: Income, credit history, loan amount, and loan term.
Loan Status: Indicators of whether loans were approved or denied.
Analysis Workflow:
Data Cleaning (Excel):

Data preparation and cleaning were carried out in Excel, involving:
Handling missing values and outliers.
Correcting inconsistent data formats.
Standardizing financial data (e.g., income, loan amounts).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Loan Approval Rates: Analyzed the key factors affecting loan approval, such as income, credit history, and loan amount.
Customer Segmentation: Grouped customers based on financial and demographic factors to understand different risk profiles.
Data Visualization with Tableau:

Summary Dashboard: Provides a high-level overview of loan approval trends, customer profiles, and overall performance.
Overview Dashboard: Visualizes key trends such as income distribution, loan approval rates, and risk factors.
Details Dashboard: Offers an in-depth exploration of specific loans and customer profiles for detailed analysis.
Feature Engineering:

Developed new features such as debt-to-income ratio to enhance model accuracy and decision-making capabilities.

Key Findings:
Important Factors for Loan Approval: Credit history, income, and loan amount significantly influence loan eligibility.
Risk Segmentation: Higher risk is associated with customers having low credit scores and high debt-to-income ratios.
Predictive Model Performance: The machine learning models effectively predict loan eligibility, assisting in minimizing loan default risks.
Tableau Dashboards:
Summary Dashboard: A snapshot of key loan approval metrics and customer segments.
Overview Dashboard: Visualizes broader trends across demographics, loan types, and financial attributes.
Details Dashboard: Enables deep-dive analysis into individual loans, customer behavior, and risk factors.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of Excel for efficient data cleaning and Tableau for impactful data visualization. By combining machine learning predictions with visual insights, banks can enhance their loan approval processes, minimize risks, and optimize lending strategies.

Technologies Used:
Excel: For data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset.
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards that visualize loan data and trends.
